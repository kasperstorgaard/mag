# Rågeleje

The summerhouses emulate the pine forest, with an external load bearing skeleton of hardwood gluelam beams, and a robust and simple detailing. A hardwood roof and terrace provides a robust wooden outer of the house. When approaching the facade and the interior, lighter and softer pinewood is used for the outer facade and windows, and inside the gradient of wood claddings is finished by a snug box of pine plywood. The plan of the houses are simple, with as little of internal circulation as possible. All rooms have doors to the exterior, providing multiple ways to use the house, also with many guests.

The summerhouse is part of four summerhouses built for a large family in northern sealand, Denmark. The site, nearby the sea, was characterized by low and crooked pine trees, and great care was taken to preserve them. The volumes of the houses were carefully rotated and placed, so that a minimal of cutting was needed.
