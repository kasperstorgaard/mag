# workshop 01

Our first collaborative workshop, together with Kasper Biltoft, a fellow architecture student, currently pursuing his Masterâ€™s thesis at Extreme Environments in The Royal Academy.

We introduced Kasper to our methods and practice, while also providing him with an opportunity to engage playfully and intuitively in his own process of creating his final thesis project. The idea is also to work together, sparring with ideas, and hopefully giving us and himself an insight to his own mind and ways of thinking, possibly unlocking hidden gems.
